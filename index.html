        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds
        of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the
        coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product:
        unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which
        transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is
        ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water
        before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.
