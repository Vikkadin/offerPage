      <p class="paragraph">
        <strong>Coffee</strong> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee
        beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the
        <em>Coffea</em>
        genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a
        stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted,
        a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted
        coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped
        in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.
